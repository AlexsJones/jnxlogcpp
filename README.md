##A note on compilers

The new C++11 compilers are a pain to install on `Debian` systems as the GNU library versions often contradict the compiler version. I recommend you ensure you use `g++-4.9` and `clang++3.5` there are also some guides on getting C++11 up and running for linux systems [here](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/242876/upgrading-gcc-on-debian-wheezy-to-support-c-11-features). OS/X users are on their own sorry!

##Deps
```
cmake
g++-4.9
clang++-3.5
```
